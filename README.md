doing our homework using an epic set of matlab/octave scripts

OBJECTIVE:
add a bunch of function files together so that they can be used to assist in homework in the future and perhaps some extremely desperate soul in the future
who would rather sit through this bs and try to make sense of it rather than sit down and understand what material they were looking at in the first place

CURRENT STATE:
Debris has been good about making files in function form but I have been extremely lazy about it and am getting stuck on the symbolic function aspect.
As of now I will keep using code as individual calculators to tab into but do plan on adapting the code to be able to be used as a function in the future
for better ease of use.
