doing our homework using an epic set of matlab/octave scripts

OBJECTIVE:
add a bunch of function files together so that they can be used to assist in homework in the future and perhaps some extremely desperate soul in the future
who would rather sit through this bs and try to make sense of it rather than sit down and understand what material they were looking at in the first place

CURRENT STATE:
I have no clue what I'm doing help me aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
