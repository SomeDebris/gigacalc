doing our homework using an epic set of matlab/octave scripts

OBJECTIVE:
add a bunch of function files together so that they can be used to assist in homework in the future and perhaps some extremely desperate soul in the future
who would rather sit through this bs and try to make sense of it rather than sit down and understand what material they were looking at in the first place

CURRENT STATE:
It is important that you can use symbolic functions (syms vars command) for specific functions to work
It would be useful to load the symbolic variables "x y z" in your workspace before running functions so that they can work properly


I have no clue what I'm doing help me aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
